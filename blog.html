        <h2><strong>Question-1: </strong>What are the differences between local storage and session storage?</h2>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong> Local storage and session storage differences is that session storage is
            destroyed
            once the user closes the browser, but local storage stores data with no expiration date.Whenever a document
            is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
            particular tab. </p>

        <h2><strong>Question-2: </strong>What are the differences between global scope and block scope ?</h2>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong><br> <strong>Global scope: </strong>The JavaScript globalscope is the contex where
            everthing in a JavaScript program excutes by defult. <br> <strong>Block scope: </strong>A block scope
            variable means that variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block. </p>

        <h2><strong>Question-3: </strong>What is event loop in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking
            operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is
            completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.</p>

        <h2><strong>Question-4: </strong>How many way we can get undefined?</h2>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong> A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method
            or
            statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
            function returns undefined if a value was not returned . </p>
